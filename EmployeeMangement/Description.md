A simple, console-based Employee Management Application built with Java.

Key Features:

Inheritance: Uses a base Employee class extended by specialized classes: Manager, Developer, and Intern.

Polymorphism: Demonstrates runtime polymorphism through the overridden displayInfo() method.

Data Structures: Utilizes ArrayList to manage and iterate over a collection of different employee types.

Employee Details: Stores and displays unique details for each role (e.g., teamSize for Manager, programmingLanguage for Developer, and durationInMonths for Intern).
